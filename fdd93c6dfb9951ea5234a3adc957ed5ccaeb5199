      "message": "The idea is to call isolate_management() only if you\u0027re going to come across a scenario with 2 default gateways in a container.\n\nThe reason we should delete the route on line 59,\n- we add it eventually in mgmt rt_table (line 61)\n- if this function has been called, it\u0027s expected on return that a new route will be added for second interface. When that happens, if prev default route exists on main rt_table, it will create a conflict and terminate. (Does not overwrite the route)",
