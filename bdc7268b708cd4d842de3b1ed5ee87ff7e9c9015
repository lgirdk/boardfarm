      "message": "Okay here we have two things:\n1) Center frequency of MAC domain set via RCC\n2) CM decide DS center frequency/primary channel dynamically while ranging.\n\nIn both the scenarios, the generic approach would be:\n- show cable modem \u003cmac\u003e\n  Fetch the channel id under DS Intf column\n- show docsis channel utilization | include \u003cDS Intf ID\u003e\n  The second value will provide the center or primary frequency for the CM.\n\nCenter frequencies are CM specific, they can be manually configure to a value on md,\nbut final value has to be done from CM.\n\nSo we should be passing cm_mac as args rather than mac_domain.",
